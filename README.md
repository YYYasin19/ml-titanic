# Machine Learning Project: Titanic Data
#### Learn from disaster

Hello, this is one of my machine learning projects on my Data Science Journey!
This project is based on Kaggle's famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

## Learning outcomes

Fundamentals for each ML projet:
- creating / handling pandas DataFrame objects (e.g. dropping columns, using operations inplace, etc.)
- editing csv's

Specific features of the sklearn architecture:
- sklearn's Pipeline architecture
- Creating custom transformers and appending to a pipeline
- Feature scaling (e.g. Standardization)
- OneHotEncoding categorical data
